		Time, Space, and Complexity.
	</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm. It is not going to examine the total execution time of an algorithm.
		The code will be more efficient also.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. It is denoted by O(n).
